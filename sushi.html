<h1>Sushi</h1>
<h3>This is why I think sushi deserves to be at the top of my list:</h3>
<h4>yes, it can give you salmonella, but that's what wasabi is for! Did you know wasabi is extremely rare and hard to find, so most sushi resturants actually use horseradish and dye it green. I don't know who I can trust anymore after knowing that>:(</h4>
